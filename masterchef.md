    - Masterchef Smart Contract handles the staking, time of staking and based on the timeframe it rewards
    - Let say you stake X amount so how much rewards you will get? This is handled by Masterchef Smart Contract
    - Block generation time is approx 3 seconds. Binance can process upto 160 trx per second
- ðŸ¤‘ Build Your Own DeFi Staking dApp - P2 - Masterchef Contract Storage
- ðŸ¤‘ Build Your Own Defi Staking dApp - P3 - Masterchef Contract Add Staking Pools
    - adding pools to smartcontracts (addPool)
    - do check for duplicate check in adding pool and updating?
    - multiplier should be mutable
- ðŸ¤‘ Build Your Own Defi Staking dApp - P4 - Masterchef Mint Reward Tokens (updatePool)
    - lastRewardBlock - the last reward block value is that block number that we are going to store in the msg of smartcontract
    - every time there is staking, unstake 
    - multiplier = (block.number - lastRewardPerBlock) * bonus_multiplier
    - tokenReward = multiplier * tokenPerBlock * poolAllocation / totalAllocation
    - if you want to give some rewards to dev or anyone it will be like this ( but this will not be taken from tokenReward but will minted new )
    - devfee = tokenReward / 10 (the percentage of rewards dev will get)
    
- Now let's calculate the rewards per share
    - pool.rewardTokenPerShare = pool.rewardTokenPerShare + (tokenReward(converIntoSabo)) / lpSupply
    - must update the lastRewardBlock e.g pool.lastRewardBlock = block.number
